# Time series generator

C version of this [program](https://github.com/G-Lorenz/time_series-generator).

## How to use
Work in progress. The program may not work.

The program uses `wget` inside C-function `system()`: it probably works only in Linux-based sistems.

## To do list
* date management;
* import several files, and not just one;
* rewrite using lists.
